"The final choice he was made to board a non-stop flight to Moscow on June 23, 2013."
To remain in Hong Kong once a criminal complaint was leveled against him would have meant
"that, at the very minimum, Hong Kong authorities would seize him and the alleged stolen property"
"of the US government in his possession. Even if he was released on bail, the Hong Kong"
authorities would almost certainly retain all the NSA and GCHQ files he had gone to such lengths
to steal. He also would not be allowed to leave Hong Kong and possibly denied any access to the
"Internet. As he demonstrated by his subsequent actions, this option was not acceptable to him."
""
"Once the U.S. criminal complaint was unsealed on June 21, 2013, which became all but"
"inevitable after his video, his only route out of Hong Kong went through two adversaries of the"
"United States, China and Russia. China, as far as is known, did not offer him sanctuary."
"According to one U.S diplomat, it may have already obtained copies of Snowden’s NSA files, and"
"did not want the problem of having Snowden defect to Beijing. In any case, if it had not already"
acquired the files. It could assume it would receive that intelligence data from its Russian ally in
"the intelligence war. Whatever its reason, China did not use its considerable power in Hong"
Kong to block Snowden’s exit.
""
Nor did Snowden obtain a visa to any country in Latin America or elsewhere during his month-
"long stay in Hong Kong. As in the oft-cited Sherlock Holmes’ clue of the dog that did not bark,"
Snowden’s lack of any visas in his passport strongly suggests that he had not made plans to go
"anyplace but where he went: Moscow. His actions here, including his contacts with Russian"
"officials in Hong Kong, speak louder than his words."
""
"Snowden chose, if he had any choice left at all, the Russian option. Just as he believed Chinese"
"intelligence could protect him in Hong Kong from the United States, he could assume that the"
FSB could protect him in Moscow from the United States. He was not entirely na* ve about its
"capabilities. During his service in the CIA, he had taken a month-long training course at the CIA’s"
“farm” at Fort Peary in which counterintelligence officer taught about the capabilities the Russian
security services
""
"To be sure, he might not have known that Moscow would be his final destination. He may"
have naively believed that Russia would allow a defector from the NSA who claimed to have had
access to the NSA’s sources in Russia and China leave Moscow before its security services
obtained that information. But that was not to be.
""
It is not uncommon for a defector to change sides in order to find a better life for himself in
another country. Some defectors flee to escape a repressive government or to find one in which
they believe they are more closely attuned. But Russia is ordinarily not the country of choice for
someone such as Snowden seeking greater civil liberties and personal freedom. So why did
Snowden choose Russia for his new life?
""
The four choices that Snowden made in 2013 did not come out of the blue. They all were
"planned out well in advance. He applied for the job to Booz Allen in February 2013, more than a"
"month before leaving his job at Dell. He applied to Booz Allen for his medical leave, although in"
"fact he had no medical problem, a month before departing for Hong Kong. He brought with him"
"to Hong Kong enough cash to pay his living expenses, according to him, for the next two years."
"He arranged the encrypted channel with Poitras in February 2013, three months before he would"
induce her to come to Hong Kong. He made contact with a foreign diplomatic mission at least a
"month before flying to Moscow and, at some point, met with Russian officials, who arranged a"
"visa-less entry for him. He called Assange in London to arrange for Wikileaks help, 13 days"

"Oslo dramatises a period of history cultivated, softly spoken Norwegian"
"– and a brief spell of optimism – that diplomat who, with his wife Mona"
"is now a distant memory. With so Juul, made it all possible by enabling"
much of the modern-day Middle East the rival delegations to meet in secret

2004 remains a source of controversy
"among his PLO loyalists, many of"
whom believe he was poisoned
"by Mossad, the Israeli intelligence"
"service. By the time Shimon Peres, the"
Nobel Prize-winning prime minister
of Israel who helped resolve many of
"the more intangible issues, died more"
"peacefully aged 93 in 2016, he had"
become one of the most accomplished
statesmen of our age.
But perhaps the greatest casualty
from that era – when there were
genuine expectations on both sides of
the Israeli-Palestinian divide that the
conflict might be resolved peacefully
"– has been the peace process itself,"
which today is almost nonexistent.
"When, for example, I told an Arab"
ambassador acquaintance I was
"going to see a preview of the play,"
he simply remarked: “No one talks
about the peace process any more. It
doesn’t exist.”
This makes Roger’s examination of
one of the most unlikely diplomatic
dialogues ever undertaken all the
"more poignant, as it harks back to"
an era when reconciliation seemed
genuinely possible.
The task facing the rival delegates
when they first meet is a daunting
"one. For the Israelis, if the fact became"
known that they were talking to the
"PLO, the government would most"
"likely fall. For the Palestinians, it"
would mean an assassin’s bullet.
At the heart of this danse macabre
"stands Rød-Larsen, whom I met on"
several occasions in Jerusalem in the
Nineties when the hard work had
begun on implementing the deal. A
"quiet, patient man, he never seemed"
to be entirely comfortable with the
rough-house atmosphere of the
"region, where disputes were often"
more likely to be resolved through
rocks and rubber bullets than rational
persuasion.
Toby Stephens’s portrayal of Rød-
Larsen gives him a great deal more
"zest and personality than I recall, but"
this neatly nuanced performance is
"key to the pace of this fast-moving,"
entertaining take on the events (Rogers
"has said that, in order to liven up what"
might otherwise seem a prosaic and
"convoluted political process, he studied"
the plays of Noël Coward).
My favourite scene from the play
is the one where the lead Israeli
"negotiator, taking a break from"
"the negotiations, entertains his"
Palestinian counterparts by giving
an impersonation of Arafat as an
"effeminate narcissist, a portrayal I"
found entirely plausible from my
"own encounters with the PLO leader,"
whose vanity knew no bounds.
"Uri Savir, who was deputed by"
Peres to run the Israeli side of the
"negotiations, was someone else I"
got to know during that period. An
urbane multi-linguist of an academic
"disposition, I generally found Uri to"
be softly spoken and thoughtful when
discussing regional issues. Philip
"Arditti’s portrayal of him in the play,"
"though, makes him out to be more"
"like the uncompromising, muscular"
"Israeli type, more usually found in the"
ranks of the security forces than in the
diplomatic service.
Depictions in theatre of almost
anything to do with the Middle East
tend to stir strong passions among
audiences. I was particularly struck by
Rogers’ sympathetic understanding
of the Palestinian predicament. “I was
very anxious about the combustibility
"of it,” said Rogers in a recent"
interview. “I assumed there would be
controversy [in America] only because
someone would be enraged that I had
allowed the ‘other side’ to have their
say.” Certainly Peter Polycarpou’s
"depiction of Ahmed Qurei, the"
Palestinian finance minister sent
"by Arafat to make peace, admirably"
captures the conflicting emotions
of enduring the pain of exile while
seeking to wreak terrible vengeance
on the Israeli occupiers.
"Indeed, for all the quips and"
"light-hearted banter, Oslo is, at heart,"
a deeply emotional drama. When the
Israelis finally strike a deal with the
Palestinians during a telephone call to
"Arafat’s headquarters in Tunis, they"
think they can hear music playing
in the background. In fact it is the
battle-hardened veterans of the PLO
sobbing at the prospect of being
allowed to return to their homeland.
"Ultimately, the play is an implicit"
tragedy about the failure of both sides
to build a lasting peace on the basis of
the painful concessions made during

Pardon the formality below - I want to approach your very legitimate questions / concerns in a serious 
manner. 
Attached and below the same. 
Dear Jeffrey: 
"As requested, the following addresses your two questions / concerns about our proposed Closer To Truth TV "
"series """"The Science of Sleep and Dreams"""": "
(i) Have there been sufficient breakthroughs in Sleep and Dreams (significantly beyond traditional 
understandings) to justify a major TV series? 
"(ii) Even if 'yes' to (i), is now the proper time for such a foundational series, or are more years needed for "
corroborative studies and further research to solidify the breakthroughs? 
"In preparing this response, my primary source is Professor Patrick McNamara, Department of Neurology, "
"Boston University School of Medicine, with whom CTT Producer/Director Peter Getzels and I spoke with at "
length today. Patrick is one of the leading sleep and dream researchers (he himself more dreams). More 
"importantly, he is perhaps the leading chronicler of the field, with many publications (including 26 entries in "
"related encyclopedias). He is co-editor-in-chief of the """"Encyclopedia of Sleep and Dreams"""" (2012) and "
"the sole author of the forthcoming """"An Introduction to the Neuroscience of Sleep and Dreams"""" (Cambridge "
"University Press, 2018), which intends to present the latest science and to become a main textbook for "
graduate courses/seminars. Patrick is a CTT contributor and colleague. 
"When we asked Patrick, his first response — """"This is the ideal time to tell the sleep-and-dreams story"""" — and he "
"cited (in essence) your two questions, in that (i) the multiple breakthroughs are now sufficiently well "
"corroborated by numerous independent labs such that a substantial foundation for the new, deeper "
understanding of sleep and dreams is now for the first time (over the past few years) confirmed and 
"established, and (ii) there are now interesting application and critical clinical questions to pose, explore and "
"pursue, such as for the treatment of various mental-related illnesses that have known sleep-related syndromes "
"(e.g., PTSD and Depression). "
"To understand the significance of recent breakthroughs, a defining characteristic of sleep and dreams is that "
there are two distinct kinds of sleep — REM (rapid-eye-movement) Sleep and NREM (non-rapid-eye-
movement) Sleep. Most dreams are associated with REM sleep (though complex). The eye movement 
"gives the eponymous name, but a more important designation defines the two stages in terms of brain waves "
(electroencephalograph — EEG): REM is Fast-Wave Sleep (similar to the waking state) and NREM Sleep is 
Slow-Wave Sleep (very different from the waking state). This difference between REM and NREM sleep has 
"been known since 1953 (different EEGs since 1937), but its deep significance has only been discovered and "
confirmed in very recent years (as explained below). 
Following are the key areas of breakthrough in sleep and dreams (from Patrick). Patrick states that these are 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025191 
"now reproducible, non-controversial, and well-accepted among experts, although still not appreciated by the "
public - hence the high value of our CTT TV series. The organizing idea is why and how are sleep and dreams 
essential for normal memory consolidation and bodily health / well-being. 
Memory Consolidation. There is a fundamental difference between REM and NREM Sleep for memory 
"consolidation: REM is for emotional memories, whereas NREM is for declarative and procedural memories. "
"Hence, understanding and dealing with REM emotional memories can lead to treatment for the many "
"neuropsychiatric illnesses that have sleep/dream-related disorders or syndromes (Parkinson's Disease, "
"Anxiety, Substance Abuse, many sleep disorders such as Nightmare Disorder, etc., in addition to PTSD and "
Depression). Research shows bi-directional causality between neuropsychiatric disorders and sleep disorders. 
This is a superb example of how fundamental science breakthroughs lead to clinical breakthroughs. This fact 
that REM is associated with emotional memories is nicely consistent with the apparent psychotic nature of 
"dreams, because in REM Sleep the frontal cortex is 'down-regulated' (and the frontal cortex is associated with "
"rational planning, reflection, controlling impulses), while in REM Sleep the limbic system is 'up-regulated"""" "
(and the limbic system is associated with emotions and feelings) — see Neuroimaging below. This is 
"why dream states flood the ego with emotional fantasies without rational control. However, it is also true that "
"the limbic system enables creative ideas, thus grounding in science the long-suspected idea that sleep and "
dreams can enhance creativity. 
"As Dr. Robert Stickgold, our other advisor on the series, wrote: """"It would be nice if we could talk about sleep "
and memory as if there were only one type of memory and one type of sleep. But this is far from the case. 
"Sleep and memory each comes in many forms, and furthermore, memories can go through multiple forms of "
"post-encoding processing that must be individually addressed."""" "
Immunity / Immune System. Strengthening the immune system is now a proven product of NREM sleep. 
"Discerning the evolutionary basis for this is a key research project (i.e., it seems counter-intuitive "
that sleeping facilitates fitness for survival in that predators lurked in the jungles and on the plains so that 
"going unconscious during sleep does not, at first glance, seem especially adaptive). Studies of sleep in various "
non-human animals reveals a direct relationship between longer periods of NREM (Slow-Wave) Sleep and a 
"stronger immune system, especially in fighting parasites. NREM Sleep releases molecules that "
"fight inflection; NREM Sleep works for the maintenance, repair and activation of the immune system. (This "
"gives scientific rationale for the need or desire to sleep during illnesses.) Related are """"genetic conflict"""" studies "
"with respect to REM and NREM, showing differences in heredity between material and paternal lines, and "
"differences between males and females in which genes get """"imprinted"""". "
Neuroplasticity. Exciting recent research has reversed the century-long conventional wisdom that new 
neurons are never created in adult animals/humans. The development of new neurons — neuronogenesis — is a 
"vital part of maintaining normal brain and mental functioning. New neurons are being created, importantly, in "
"the hippocampus (brain organ where new memories are encoded) — but, remarkably, the neuronogensis in "
the hippocampus occurs only/largely during REM Sleep — a stunning finding. This is another reason why 
REM sleep is needed for emotional memory consolidation (normal functioning). 
"Dream-Content. Although dreams have sparked human fascination and fantasy for thousands of years, only "
"in very recent years, have large-scale surveys been conducted with rigorous design, classifications and "
"statistical analysis. Literally hundreds of thousands of dreams are enabling statistically significant theories, "
including cross-cultural analyses (similarities and differences). Dream-posting sites have revolutionized size 
"and structure of dream data sets. This enables, for the first time, longitudinal studies of dreams over time. "
"Patterns are repeated. For example, in general, the dreams of males and females differ in fundamental ways. "
Males will engage in fighting with other males; females with both males and females. Male dreamers 
are often the initiator of fights and the fights are usually physical. Females fight verbally. Aggressiveness
