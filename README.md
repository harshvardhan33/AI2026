# AI-2026
An end-to-end technical repository featuring hands-on notebooks across the full AI stack: Statistics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, GenAI, and Agentic frameworks. Focused on 2026 industry standards, this collection bridges the gap between fundamental revision and experimental AI development.

/01-Stats: Probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and Bayesian inference implementations.
/02-ML: Classical algorithms (Regression, Trees, SVMs) built from scratch and optimized via Scikit-Learn.
/03-DL: Neural network architectures, Computer Vision, and NLP using PyTorch/TensorFlow.
/04-GenAI: LLM fine-tuning, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and prompt engineering patterns.
/05-AgenticAI: Multi-agent systems, tool-use frameworks (LangGraph/CrewAI), and autonomous goal-seeking loops.
