# AI-2026
An end-to-end technical repository featuring hands-on notebooks across the full AI stack: Statistics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, GenAI, and Agentic frameworks. Focused on 2026 industry standards, this collection bridges the gap between fundamental revision and experimental AI development.

## 📂 Directory Structure & Core Modules

This repository is organized into five specialized pillars, tracking the progression from foundational theory to autonomous system design:

* **`/01-Stats`**: Core mathematical foundations including **Probability Distributions**, **Hypothesis Testing** (Frequentist), and **Bayesian Inference** implementations to ensure statistical rigor.
* **`/02-ML`**: Comprehensive exploration of **Classical Algorithms** (Linear/Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVMs). Features implementations **built from scratch** to understand the mechanics, alongside production-ready optimizations via **Scikit-Learn**.
* **`/03-DL`**: Deep Dive into **Neural Network Architectures**. Covers **Computer Vision** (CNNs, Transformers) and **Natural Language Processing** (RNNs, Attention) using **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**.
* **`/04-GenAI`**: Focusing on Large Language Models, including **LLM Fine-tuning** (PEFT/LoRA), advanced **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** architectures, and systematic **Prompt Engineering** patterns.
* **`/05-AgenticAI`**: The frontier of AI development. Implementation of **Multi-agent Systems**, **Tool-use frameworks** (Langchain,LangGraph), and **Autonomous Goal-seeking loops** for complex task orchestration.
